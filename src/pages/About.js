        Welcome to LinkedOut, the professional network for people who’ve professionally given up.
        We’re like LinkedIn, but with less networking and more existential dread.
        Whether you're jobless, joyless, or just here to procrastinate — you're one of us now.
        Join us, and let’s fail upwards together.
      </p>
